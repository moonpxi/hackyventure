hackyventure
============

Hacky implementation of a text adventure engine. Have free text entry, multiple choices and very simplified combat.

I am experimenting with two implementations:

* situations: based on situations and outcomes. Each situation have a limited set of actions.
* scenes: like a theater scene. A segment of the story, in a single setting.
